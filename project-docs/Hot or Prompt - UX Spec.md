# Hot or Prompt — UX Spec

> Part of [[MOC - Hot or Prompt]]

This is the front-end UX spec. The [[Hot or Prompt - Architecture]] describes the system layer (data, functions, auth); this doc describes what the user *sees* — every screen, every state, every interaction. The spec is organized screen-catalog-first so an agent can implement screen-by-screen, with cross-cutting concerns (components, states, accessibility, microcopy) factored into their own sections for reference.

Vocabulary is locked in [[Hot or Prompt - Glossary]]. If a term here doesn't match the glossary, the glossary wins.

## 1. Design principles

Six opinionated constraints that everything below has to respect.

1. **Desktop-first (1280+).** This is a power tool. Mobile is read-only blind-eval view only; every other route shows a "desktop required" screen under 768px. See [Section 14](#14-responsive-model).
2. **Dense but calm.** Power-tool density with generous vertical rhythm. No cards-in-a-grid-of-cards. Lists beat cards. Tables beat lists where alignment matters. Whitespace beats dividers.
3. **Streaming feels live, not loading.** Outputs fill in via reactive subscriptions the moment chunks arrive. No spinners on streamable endpoints — only skeletons on non-streamable initial loads.
4. **Keyboard-first where reasonable.** Every frequently-used path has a shortcut, and `⌘K` opens a command palette that can reach every screen in two keystrokes.
5. **Blind-eval is a security surface, not a UX convenience.** The UI avoids leaking version info through every browser surface — URL, page title, breadcrumb, tooltip, tab title, favicon, network response, clipboard, `view-source`. Evaluators are the most constrained users in the app; see [Section 10](#10-blind-eval-security-rules).
6. **The annotation is the primary verb.** The Tiptap select-to-comment interaction is the most-used action in the product and gets the highest-affordance treatment. Annotations are immediately visible, immediately editable (if yours), and never more than two clicks away.

## 2. Information architecture (sitemap)

```
/                                              → redirects to /orgs/:defaultOrgSlug (or /onboarding)
/auth/sign-in                                   → OAuth + magic link entry
/auth/magic-link/callback                       → magic link token exchange
/onboarding                                     → first-run: create your first org
/eval                                           → evaluator inbox (role=evaluator lands here after auth)
/eval/:opaqueRunToken                           → blind evaluator view (only eval route they can visit)
/orgs/:orgSlug                                  → org home: project list
/orgs/:orgSlug/settings                         → org general settings
/orgs/:orgSlug/settings/members                 → org member + role management
/orgs/:orgSlug/settings/openrouter-key          → BYOK: set / rotate / check status
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId              → project home: current version, recent runs, pending optimizations
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/versions     → version history / timeline
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/versions/:versionId → version editor (system + user template + variables chips + attachments + config + Run)
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/variables    → project variable manager
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/test-cases   → test case manager
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/test-cases/:testCaseId → test case editor
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/meta-context → meta-context Q&A editor (Owner only)
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/runs/:runId  → run detail (editor/owner — full metadata + outputs + feedback)
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/compare      → cross-version comparison
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/optimizations/:requestId → optimization review (old vs new diff + changes + accept/reject)
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/settings     → project general settings
/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/settings/collaborators → project collaborator invite + role management
/profile                                        → user profile / session settings
/404                                            → not found
/denied                                         → permission denied
```

**Why `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` is separate from the editor routes.** The blind eval route never contains `versionId`, `projectId`, or `runId` in the URL. The token is a short-lived server-signed string that Convex resolves server-side to a runId + evaluator authorization check. If an evaluator copy-pastes the URL, they leak only the opaque token (which expires). If they're also authorized as Editor on the project, [Rule 7 in Section 10](#10-blind-eval-security-rules) blocks them from the eval route entirely.

## 3. Role-aware shell

The application shell (top bar + side nav + main content) differs by role.

### Owner / Editor shell

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Org switcher ▾]   Hot or Prompt                        [⌘K]  [User ▾]   │  ← top bar
├─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│ PROJECTS        │                                                         │
│ • My prompt     │                                                         │
│ • Onboarding    │              MAIN CONTENT                                │

│                 │                                                         │
│ — — — —         │                                                         │
│ + New project   │                                                         │
│                 │                                                         │
│                 │                                                         │
│ ORG SETTINGS    │                                                         │
│ • Members       │                                                         │
│ • OpenRouter    │                                                         │
│                 │                                                         │
└─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Within a project, a secondary nav appears as tabs at the top of the main content area:

```
Editor  Versions  Runs  Test Cases  Variables  Meta Context  Compare  Settings
```

### Evaluator shell

Radically stripped. No org switcher, no project sidebar, no secondary tabs. The shell shows only:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Hot or Prompt  —  Evaluation                                  [User ▾]   │  ← top bar
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The top bar does **not** show the project name on the `/eval` inbox (the inbox shows each item's project name inline, once, so evaluators can orient without leaking version info globally). On `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`, the top bar shows `"Evaluation — {project name}"` with no version, no run ID, no breadcrumb beyond that string.

Evaluators signed in with any other role on a project see that project through its normal Owner/Editor shell. You cannot be blinded to information you already have (see [Rule 7 in Section 10](#10-blind-eval-security-rules)).

---

## 4. Screen catalog

Each screen entry has: **route**, **roles**, **purpose**, **layout**, **primary actions**, **secondary actions**, **states** (from [Section 6](#6-state-catalog)), **transitions out**, **blind-eval rules** (if applicable), **shortcuts** (if applicable).

### 4.1 Landing / marketing
- **Route**: `/` (when not authenticated) — actually served from a separate Vercel deployment in [[Hot or Prompt - Build Plan]] M7; mentioned here for completeness.
- **Roles**: Anonymous.
- **Purpose**: Explain what Hot or Prompt is and funnel to sign-in.
- **Layout**: Hero headline + tagline + "Sign in" button + short section explaining the collaborative prompt eval loop.
- **Primary actions**: Sign in.
- **States**: Populated only (static page).
- **Transitions out**: `/auth/sign-in`.

### 4.2 Sign in
- **Route**: `/auth/sign-in`.
- **Roles**: Anonymous.
- **Purpose**: Authenticate via Google OAuth or magic link email.
- **Layout**: Centered single-column card. Logo at top, headline ("Sign in to Hot or Prompt"), Google button, horizontal rule with "or" label, email input + "Send magic link" button, tiny footer with "What is this?" link to landing.
- **Primary actions**: Google sign-in, send magic link.
- **States**: Loading (during OAuth redirect), Error (OAuth failed, email invalid, rate-limited), Populated.
- **Transitions out**: `/onboarding` (no org yet), `/orgs/:orgSlug` (default org exists), `/eval` (evaluator role only).

### 4.3 Magic link callback
- **Route**: `/auth/magic-link/callback?token=...`.
- **Purpose**: Exchange the token for a session and redirect.
- **Layout**: Spinner + "Signing you in..." text.
- **States**: Loading, Error (token expired / invalid).
- **Transitions out**: Same as sign-in success.

### 4.4 First-run onboarding
- **Route**: `/onboarding`.
- **Roles**: Authenticated, no org membership.
- **Purpose**: Create the user's first organization.
- **Layout**: Centered card. Headline ("Create your workspace"), input for org name, derived slug preview below the input, "Create" button.
- **Primary actions**: Create org.
- **Secondary actions**: Sign out.
- **States**: Populated, Loading, Error (slug collision).
- **Transitions out**: `/orgs/:orgSlug` (freshly created) → automatic prompt to set OpenRouter key.

### 4.5 Org home / project list
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug`.
- **Roles**: Org member with at least one project, OR Owner/Editor on at least one project in the org.
- **Purpose**: Land here after auth. Show projects and get to work.
- **Layout**: Full shell (Owner/Editor shell from [Section 3](#3-role-aware-shell)). Main content: "Projects" heading + "New project" button top-right, then a dense list (not grid). Each row: project name, current version pill (`v3 · active`), last run timestamp ("Run 2h ago"), collaborator avatars (max 5 + "+N"), chevron.
- **Primary actions**: Open a project, new project.
- **Secondary actions**: Archive project (hover), star project (future).
- **States**: Empty ("No projects yet. Create your first project to start drafting prompts."), Loading (skeleton rows), Populated.
- **Transitions out**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId`, `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/new` (modal).
- **Shortcuts**: `⌘K` palette, `N` to create a new project, `↑/↓` to select, `Enter` to open.

### 4.6 Org settings → general
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/settings`.
- **Roles**: Owner.
- **Purpose**: Rename the org, update the slug, upload a logo.
- **Layout**: Two-column form. Left: form fields (name, slug, logo uploader). Right: a danger zone card at the bottom ("Delete organization").
- **Primary actions**: Save.
- **States**: Populated, Saving, Error (slug collision).

### 4.7 Org settings → members
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/settings/members`.
- **Roles**: Owner.
- **Purpose**: Invite + manage org members.
- **Layout**: "Invite member" input (email) with role picker (owner/admin/member) and "Send invite" button on top. Below: a table of current members (avatar, name, email, role, joined, actions).
- **Primary actions**: Invite member, change role, remove member.
- **States**: Populated, Loading, Error (user already exists, invite failed).

### 4.8 Org settings → OpenRouter key (BYOK)
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/settings/openrouter-key`.
- **Roles**: Owner.
- **Purpose**: Set or rotate the org's OpenRouter API key. The key is never shown back to the user; this screen shows presence only.
- **Layout**: Single centered card. Headline ("OpenRouter API key"), status line ("Key set · last rotated 2d ago" OR "No key set"), a masked input (always empty) labelled "New key", "Save key" button, and a tiny help section with a link to OpenRouter's dashboard.
- **Primary actions**: Save key.
- **Secondary actions**: None (no "reveal key" — the backend literally cannot return it).
- **States**: Populated (has key), Empty (no key), Saving, Error (encryption failed, key invalid format).
- **Transitions out**: Back to org home.

### 4.9 Project home
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: The project dashboard. Summarize state, point at next actions.
- **Layout**: Project title + secondary nav at the top. Main content is a 2/3 + 1/3 split:
  - **Left (2/3)**: "Current version" card (version number, status pill, diff-stat vs parent, "Edit" button); below it, "Recent runs" list (5 most recent runs with timestamp, test case name, model, status pill, 3 blind-label mini-previews).
  - **Right (1/3)**: Collaborators list (avatars with role badges), pending optimization requests count with link, meta-context completeness ("3 of 3 questions answered"), BYOK status ("Key set" / "No key — set one").
- **Primary actions**: Edit current version, view recent run, request optimization (if feedback exists).
- **Secondary actions**: View all versions, view all runs, invite collaborator.
- **States**: Populated, Empty (new project with no versions — shows a "Draft your first prompt" CTA that jumps to the version editor).

### 4.10 Version list / history
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/versions`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Browse every version of the prompt with provenance.
- **Layout**: Left-rail vertical timeline. Each version is a node: version number badge, status pill, created timestamp, creator avatar, one-line `changesSummary` from the linked optimization request (if any). Edges between nodes render `parentVersionId`; rollback nodes additionally show a dashed edge to `sourceVersionId` with a "rolled back from v2" label. Clicking a node opens it in the version editor.
- **Primary actions**: Open version, rollback to version.
- **Secondary actions**: Archive, duplicate as draft.
- **States**: Populated, Empty.
- **Shortcuts**: `J/K` to move between versions in the timeline.

### 4.11 Version editor
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/versions/:versionId`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Write the system message and user template, pick a model, pick a test case, run the prompt.
- **Layout**: Three-column.
  - **Left (20%)**: Variable list (project-scoped) with drag-reorder handles. Each variable: name, description tooltip, default value, required flag. Click `+` to add; click a variable to edit in a popover. Dropping a variable into the template inserts `{{name}}`.
  - **Center (55%)**: Tiptap editor split into two stacked panes:
    - **System message** (optional, collapsible if empty). Renders Mustache `{{chips}}` inline.
    - **User message template** (required). Same rendering.
    - Both panes share selection-to-comment for [prompt feedback](#82-prompt-feedback-annotations).
    - Below the panes: attachment tray (prompt-level attachments — thumbnails + drag reorder + upload button).
  - **Right (25%)**: Run config + run button.
    - Test case dropdown (from the project's test cases).
    - Model dropdown (`<ModelPicker>` with vision filter if attachments exist).
    - Temperature slider.
    - Max tokens input.
    - Run count input (default 3).
    - "More" disclosure: seed, top-p, stop sequences (hidden by default).
    - **[Run prompt]** button — disabled if draft has a validation error, if no test case is selected, if no OpenRouter key is set, or if the concurrent-run cap is reached.
    - Below the run button: "Recent runs for this version" (3 most recent, compact).
- **Primary actions**: Save draft, run prompt, promote draft to active.
- **Secondary actions**: Duplicate as draft, archive version, delete (draft only).
- **States**: Populated, Saving, Validation error (missing variable, unsupported syntax), Streaming (if a run is in progress from this screen), Read-only (archived or active+viewing history).
- **Transitions out**: Run execution view (`/runs/:runId`), version list, test case manager.
- **Shortcuts**: `⌘Enter` to run, `⌘S` to save draft, `C` to comment on selection, `⌘R` to request optimization.

### 4.12 Variable manager
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/variables`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: CRUD for project variables independent of the version editor.
- **Layout**: Simple table. Columns: Name, Description, Default value, Required, Used in (list of version numbers), Actions. Drag handle on the left for reorder. "Add variable" button top-right.
- **Primary actions**: Add, edit, delete, reorder.
- **States**: Populated, Empty.

### 4.13 Test case manager
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/test-cases`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: CRUD for test cases. List view.
- **Layout**: Left-rail list of test cases (name, variable count, attachment count). Right pane: preview of the selected test case — variable name/value table, attachment thumbnails. "+ New test case" button above the list.
- **Primary actions**: Create, open in editor, duplicate, delete.
- **Secondary actions**: Reorder.
- **States**: Populated, Empty.

### 4.14 Test case editor
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/test-cases/:testCaseId`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Edit a single test case.
- **Layout**: Top: test case name input. Middle: a form where each row is a project variable with its value for this test case (pre-filled with the variable's `defaultValue` if present). Bottom: attachment tray (test-case-level attachments — upload, reorder, delete). Save button bottom-right.
- **Primary actions**: Save.
- **States**: Populated, Saving, Error.

### 4.15 Meta context Q&A editor
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/meta-context`.
- **Roles**: **Owner only**.
- **Purpose**: Answer the meta-prompting context questions that feed the optimizer.
- **Layout**: Stack of question/answer pairs. Each row: question on the left (bold), answer on the right (textarea), reorder handle. "Add question" button at the bottom. A side panel on the right shows suggested questions ("What domain?", "What tone?", "Who is the end user?", "What should the model never do?") that can be added with one click.
- **Primary actions**: Add, edit, save, remove a question.
- **States**: Populated, Empty ("Meta context feeds the optimizer. Add at least one question before your first optimization to ground the rewrite in your project's intent.").

### 4.16 Run execution view (streaming)
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/runs/:runId` immediately after clicking Run.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Watch outputs stream in live and see them finalize.
- **Layout**: Header with run metadata (version, test case name, model, temperature, triggered by, started at). Below: a three-column grid (for `runCount=3`). Each column is a `<StreamingOutputPanel>` with:
  - Blind label badge at the top left (`A`, `B`, `C`).
  - `<RunStatusPill>` at the top right (`pending` → `running` → `completed` / `failed`).
  - The output text, filling in live via a reactive subscription on `runOutputs`.
  - A subtle `▋` cursor at the tail of the text until `status: completed`.
  - On completion: token counts, latency, a "Leave feedback" button that opens the Tiptap annotation mode on this panel.
  - On failure: the error message in red, a "Retry this output" button.
- **Primary actions**: Leave feedback, retry, run again, go back to editor.
- **Secondary actions**: Copy output text, expand to full-screen panel.
- **States**: Streaming, Populated, Error (all three outputs failed).
- **Transitions out**: Run detail (same route; it's the same page), editor.
- **Shortcuts**: `J/K` to cycle focused output, `C` to comment on selection in the focused output.

### 4.17 Run detail (editor/owner view)
- **Route**: same as 4.16 after completion.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Review a completed run with full metadata and all feedback.
- **Layout**: Same structure as 4.16 but fully populated. Below the three output panels: an "All feedback on this run" list grouped by output, plus a "Prompt feedback on this version" link at the top.
- **Primary actions**: Leave feedback, request optimization, compare across versions.
- **Secondary actions**: Export run as JSON (debug), delete run.

### 4.18 Output viewer with Tiptap annotations
- **Embedded within**: 4.16 run execution view and 4.28 blind evaluator view. Not a standalone route.
- **Purpose**: The central evaluation UI. Select text → comment on it. See existing annotations. Edit your own.
- **Layout**: The output text in a Tiptap editor (read-only for text content, annotatable on top). Existing annotations render as colored highlights. Hovering a highlight shows a tooltip with the author name (if not evaluator view) and the comment. Clicking opens a side panel with the annotation thread (comment, edit button if yours, delete button if yours).
- **Primary interaction**: Select → comment button fades in at the selection end → click → popover with textarea + Submit → annotation persists → highlight remains. See [Section 8.1](#81-tiptap-comment-on-selection) for the detailed pattern.
- **States**: Read-only (no feedback yet), Populated (annotations visible), Editing (a comment is in-flight).

### 4.19 Prompt feedback view
- **Embedded within**: 4.11 version editor when the editor is in "review feedback" mode.
- **Purpose**: Tiptap annotations on the prompt itself (system message and user template).
- **Layout**: Identical to the version editor but read-only; the two Tiptap panes are annotatable in the same way as output viewer. Switching into this mode is a toggle at the top of the editor ("View feedback" / "Back to editing").

### 4.20 Feedback viewer
- **Route**: reached from the version editor or run detail via a "All feedback" link; does not have its own primary URL in v1 (opens in a modal side-sheet).
- **Purpose**: Aggregated list of every output feedback + prompt feedback item for a version.
- **Layout**: Sheet sliding in from the right edge. Tabs at the top: `Output feedback` · `Prompt feedback`. List of entries, each showing: author, timestamp, target (which output / which field), highlighted text (quoted), comment. Clicking an entry jumps to that annotation in the relevant editor.

### 4.21 Optimization request (trigger + waiting)
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/optimizations/:requestId`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Trigger an optimization and watch it process.
- **Layout**: Full-page. Top: "Optimizing version v3" headline + cancel button. Middle: a live status card (`pending` → `processing` → `completed` / `failed`) with a neutral animation (not a spinner — a soft pulse). Below: a read-only preview of what's being fed to the optimizer ("We're sending: 12 output feedback items, 3 prompt feedback items, 3 meta-context answers") so the user has context while waiting.
- **Primary actions**: Cancel.
- **Transitions out**: Automatically transitions to the review screen (4.22) when `status: completed`; to an error state on `failed`.

### 4.22 Optimization review
- **Route**: same as 4.21 once the request is complete.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Review the proposed new prompt and decide.
- **Layout**: Two columns plus a bottom action bar.
  - **Left**: `<PromptDiff>` between the current version and the proposed new prompt, side-by-side by default (toggle to unified). System message and user template as separate diffs.
  - **Right**: `<ChangesPanel>` rendering `changesSummary` (bulleted markdown) and `changesReasoning` (prose).
  - **Bottom action bar**: `[Reject]` · `[Edit and accept]` · `[Accept]` (primary). "Edit and accept" opens an inline editor pre-populated with the proposed new prompt, letting the user tweak before creating the new version.
- **Primary actions**: Accept, edit and accept, reject.
- **States**: Populated, Saving (during accept), Error (validation failed on the LLM output, per [[Hot or Prompt - Optimizer Meta-Prompt]] Section 5).
- **Transitions out**: Newly-created version editor (on accept), back to version list (on reject).

### 4.23 Cross-version comparison
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/compare`.
- **Roles**: Owner, Editor.
- **Purpose**: Run the same test case across multiple versions and compare outputs side by side.
- **Layout**: Top: test case picker (single-select) + version multi-picker (checkboxes, 2–5 versions). Middle: a grid with one column per version. Each column is a run-result panel identical to [Section 4.17](#417-run-detail-editorowner-view) but compact. At the top of each column: version number + changed-from-previous indicator.
- **Primary actions**: Run comparison (executes missing runs in parallel), leave feedback inside any panel.
- **Secondary actions**: Swap test case, add/remove versions.
- **States**: Empty (nothing picked yet), Loading, Streaming (runs still executing), Populated.

### 4.24 Version rollback confirmation
- **Embedded**: modal on top of the version list or version editor.
- **Purpose**: Confirm a rollback with clear provenance language.
- **Layout**: Centered modal. Headline: "Roll back to version 2?". Body: "This creates a new version at the head of the timeline with the content of v2. The timeline will show: v3 (current) → v4 (rolled back from v2)." Buttons: `[Cancel]` · `[Roll back]` (primary).
- **States**: Populated, Saving.

### 4.25 Project settings → general
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/settings`.
- **Roles**: Owner.
- **Purpose**: Rename, describe, delete project.
- **Layout**: Two-column form (name, description) + danger zone card ("Delete project") at the bottom.
- **Primary actions**: Save, delete.

### 4.26 Project settings → collaborators
- **Route**: `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/settings/collaborators`.
- **Roles**: Owner.
- **Purpose**: Invite + manage project collaborators with Owner/Editor/Evaluator roles.
- **Layout**: Invite row (email input + role picker + Send). Below: a table of current collaborators (avatar, name, email, `<RoleBadge>`, invited by, accepted at, actions). Explicit helper text: "Evaluators can only see blinded outputs and leave feedback. They cannot see versions or know which version produced which output."
- **Primary actions**: Invite, change role, remove.
- **States**: Populated, Empty (only the owner listed).

### 4.27 Blind evaluator inbox
- **Route**: `/eval`.
- **Roles**: Evaluator (and is the landing page for pure evaluators after auth).
- **Purpose**: List of runs awaiting evaluation.
- **Layout**: Top bar shows only "Hot or Prompt — Evaluation" (no org name, no project globally). Main content: a list of inbox items. Each item shows:
  - Project name (scoped — only the evaluator's projects).
  - Number of outputs in the run (e.g., "3 outputs").
  - Invited-at timestamp relative ("Invited 2h ago").
  - A status chip: `Pending feedback` or `Feedback submitted`.
- **What is NOT shown**: version number, version name, run ID, model, temperature, test case name (test case names can leak intent), who triggered the run.
- **Primary actions**: Open a run.
- **Secondary actions**: Mark all as skipped (future).
- **States**: Populated, Empty ("You're all caught up. Waiting for new runs.").
- **Transitions out**: `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`.
- **Blind-eval rules applied**: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12 (see [Section 10](#10-blind-eval-security-rules)).

### 4.28 Blind evaluator view
- **Route**: `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`.
- **Roles**: Evaluator.
- **Purpose**: The security-sensitive screen. Show the run's outputs labeled A/B/C and let the evaluator annotate them.
- **Layout**: Top bar: `"Evaluation — {project name}"`. Main content:
  - Above the outputs: a neutral instruction card — "Leave feedback on each output by selecting text and commenting. Outputs are labeled A/B/C to remove bias. Submit when you're done."
  - Three-column grid of outputs, each a `<StreamingOutputPanel>`-turned-`<AnnotatedEditor>` (read-only text, annotatable overlay). Each panel shows only:
    - `<BlindLabelBadge>` ("A" / "B" / "C").
    - The output text.
    - An annotation count badge ("3 comments").
    - A "Leave feedback on this output" affordance (which is just "select text to comment", surfaced by an inline hint the first time).
  - Bottom: a "Submit feedback" button that marks the evaluator's session as complete and optionally auto-advances to the next inbox item.
- **Primary actions**: Annotate text, submit.
- **Secondary actions**: Back to inbox.
- **States**: Populated, Read-only (after submit), Denied (token expired — redirect to `/eval`).
- **Blind-eval rules applied**: ALL 13 rules in [Section 10](#10-blind-eval-security-rules).
- **Shortcuts**: `C` to comment on selection, `J/K` to cycle focus across the three columns, `⌘Enter` to submit comment.

### 4.29 Profile / account
- **Route**: `/profile`.
- **Roles**: Any authenticated user.
- **Purpose**: View name + email, sign out, manage sessions.
- **Layout**: Simple form. Name (editable), email (read-only), avatar (upload), sign-out button, "Sign out everywhere" button.

### 4.30 Error screens
- **Routes**: `/404`, `/denied`, session-expired inline redirect.
- **Layout**: Centered card with a headline matching the error kind, a one-line explanation, and a single CTA back to a sensible place (home for 404, sign-in for session expired, previous page for denied).

---

## 5. Component inventory

Reusable components referenced across the screen catalog. Each is a single well-scoped surface.

- **`<VersionSelector>`** — Dropdown with draft/active/archived groups and a mini-timeline hint showing parent/source-version edges. Used in the version list, run detail, and compare screen.
- **`<ModelPicker>`** — OpenRouter model dropdown with filtering for vision-capable models (auto-filters when any attachment is present on the prompt or test case). Shows model name + provider + context window + vision capability icon.
- **`<VariableChip>`** — Inline chip rendered by the Tiptap editor when the template contains `{{name}}`. Click to edit the variable's default value in a popover. Color-coded by required/optional.
- **`<AttachmentCard>`** — Thumbnail (or filetype icon) + filename + size + delete button. Drag-reorderable. Used for both prompt attachments and test-case attachments.
- **`<StreamingOutputPanel>`** — Renders `outputContent` from a Convex reactive subscription. Chunks append as they arrive; a `▋` cursor at the tail until `status: completed`. Shows status pill, blind label badge, and token counts + latency on completion.
- **`<BlindLabelBadge>`** — Neutral pill with "A" / "B" / "C" / ... Single color, no hover tooltip beyond `aria-label="Output A"`. Used everywhere an evaluator might see an output.
- **`<AnnotatedEditor>`** — Tiptap wrapper with selection-triggered comment bubble, thread side panel, and read-only mode. Renders existing annotations as highlights. Handles the full select → comment → submit → persist loop.
- **`<PromptDiff>`** — Unified or side-by-side diff between two strings, with move detection. Color-blind-safe palette (blue/purple, not red/green). Used in optimization review and version history.
- **`<ChangesPanel>`** — Renders `changesSummary` (markdown bullets) and `changesReasoning` (prose) from an `optimizationRequest`. Pure display.
- **`<MetaContextEditor>`** — Q&A form for `projects.metaContext`. Add/remove/reorder questions; textarea for each answer.
- **`<RunStatusPill>`** — Pill rendering `pending` / `running` / `completed` / `failed` with distinct colors and icons.
- **`<RoleBadge>`** — Owner / Editor / Evaluator pill with distinct colors. Used in collaborator tables and role-change menus.
- **`<ConcurrentRunGauge>`** — Small gauge showing in-flight runs vs the soft cap (e.g., "3 / 10 in flight"). Appears in the version editor's Run button area when runs > 0.
- **`<EmptyState>`** — Illustration slot + headline + description + CTA button. Used across every list view. See [Section 9](#9-empty--error--loading-state-catalog) for the specific copies.
- **`<CommandPalette>`** — `⌘K` fuzzy finder across projects, versions, test cases, runs, and primary actions ("New project", "New test case"). Keyboard-only navigation inside the palette.

---

## 6. State catalog

Every screen references states by name from this list. Implementing a state once and using it everywhere keeps the product feeling consistent.

- **Loading** — Skeleton shimmer, not a spinner. For initial data fetches; transitions to `Populated` or `Error: *` when the reactive query resolves. Always has a specific skeleton shape matching the target layout (not a generic grey box).
- **Empty** — A first-time or zero-state view. Always has a specific component copy (see [Section 9](#9-empty--error--loading-state-catalog)), not a generic "no data".
- **Error: auth** — Session expired or not authenticated. Immediate redirect to `/auth/sign-in` with a `redirect=` query param so the user lands back where they were after signing in.
- **Error: permission** — Authenticated but not authorized for this resource. Full-screen "You don't have access to this" + a "Back" button. Never reveal whether the resource exists or is simply hidden.
- **Error: network** — Can't reach Convex. Inline banner ("Couldn't reach Convex. [Retry]") at the top of the affected area. Doesn't block the rest of the page.
- **Error: notFound** — 404. Full-screen "Not found" + a CTA back to the user's default org.
- **Streaming** — A run is in progress. The affected area renders `<StreamingOutputPanel>`s. Interactive controls that could interrupt the stream (cancel, retry, navigate away with unsaved edits) are disabled until the stream completes or fails.
- **Populated** — The happy path.
- **ReadOnly** — Used for evaluators, for finalized outputs, and for archived versions. All mutation affordances are hidden (not disabled — hidden, so the UI doesn't hint at permissions the user doesn't have).

Error states are always distinguishable from each other. "Something went wrong" is banned copy.

## 7. User flows

Six end-to-end journeys that cross multiple screens. Each flow is written as a numbered sequence with decision points.

### 7.1 First-run onboarding flow

1. User arrives at `/` → no session → redirected to `/auth/sign-in`.
2. User signs in with Google.
3. No org membership exists → redirected to `/onboarding`.
4. User enters org name → submits → org created → redirected to `/orgs/:orgSlug`.
5. Org home shows an empty projects list with a prominent inline blocker: **"Set your OpenRouter key to start running prompts"** pointing at `/orgs/:orgSlug/settings/openrouter-key`.
6. User clicks through, sets key, returns to org home.
7. User clicks "New project" → modal asks for project name + optional description → creates project → redirected to `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId`.
8. Project home shows an empty state: **"Draft your first prompt"** CTA → user clicks → redirected to version editor with a new draft pre-created (`v1`, status `draft`).
9. Version editor shows inline callouts the first time: "Add a variable", "Write your user template", "Add a test case", "Click Run".
10. User adds a variable, writes `Translate the following to Spanish: {{text}}`, clicks "Add test case", switches to test case editor, fills in `text` value, returns to editor.
11. User picks a model, clicks **Run prompt** (`⌘Enter`) → redirected to run execution view.
12. Outputs stream in live across three columns.
13. User leaves an annotation on Output B ("This is too literal").
14. User clicks **Request optimization** → waiting screen → review screen.
15. User accepts the new version → redirected to new version editor (v2).
16. User clicks "Invite collaborator" in the right-hand project sidebar → invites two people: one as Editor, one as Evaluator.

### 7.2 Evaluator flow

1. Evaluator receives an email invitation (magic link).
2. Clicks link → `/auth/magic-link/callback` → session created.
3. User's only role is Evaluator on a single project → automatically redirected to `/eval`.
4. Inbox shows one item: project name, "3 outputs", "Invited 2h ago", "Pending feedback". **No** version, model, test case name.
5. Evaluator clicks the item → navigates to `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`.
6. View shows `"Evaluation — {project name}"` in top bar + instruction card + three output columns with A/B/C badges.
7. Evaluator selects a phrase in Output A → comment bubble fades in → clicks → textarea popover → types comment → Submit.
8. Annotation persists as a highlight. Repeats across outputs.
9. Evaluator clicks **Submit feedback** → run marked evaluated → inbox auto-advances to the next item (or empty state).
10. At any point, hitting back or trying to visit any other route bounces the evaluator back to `/eval`.

### 7.3 Optimization flow

1. Editor has collected feedback across a version's runs and prompt.
2. From the version editor OR the feedback viewer sheet, editor clicks **Request optimization** (`⌘R`).
3. Confirmation modal: "Optimize version v3? This reads all feedback and meta-context and proposes a new prompt. You'll review before anything is saved."
4. Click Optimize → new `optimizationRequest` created → navigates to `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/optimizations/:requestId`.
5. Waiting screen shows input preview ("Sending: 12 output feedback items, 3 prompt feedback items, 3 meta context answers") + soft-pulsing status card.
6. Convex action completes → status flips to `completed` → screen auto-transitions to the review layout.
7. Review screen shows old-vs-new diff on the left and `changesSummary` + `changesReasoning` on the right.
8. Editor reads the reasoning, reviews the diff, clicks **Accept**.
9. New version created → redirected to the new version editor.

Failure branch: if the LLM output fails validation (per [[Hot or Prompt - Optimizer Meta-Prompt]] Section 5), the review screen shows the error message and a "Try again" button instead of the diff.

### 7.4 Cross-version comparison flow

1. From project home or the Compare tab, user lands on `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId/compare`.
2. Test case picker + version multi-picker. Empty state: "Pick a test case and at least two versions to compare."
3. User picks test case "short-input" + checks versions v1, v2, v3.
4. User clicks **Run comparison** → the system schedules runs for any (testCase, version) pair that doesn't already have a recent run; existing runs are reused.
5. Three-column grid appears with panels streaming in. Each column has the version number at the top.
6. User spot-reads the outputs and leaves an annotation in the v2 column.
7. Annotations are written against the specific run that produced the output (so they're tied to a version, not to the comparison view).

### 7.5 Rollback flow

1. User is unhappy with v3 → navigates to version list.
2. Scrolls the timeline, clicks v2.
3. Version list shows v2's content and a **Roll back to v2** button.
4. Click → confirmation modal with explicit language: "This creates a new version at the head of the timeline with the content of v2. The timeline will show: v3 (current) → v4 (rolled back from v2)."
5. Confirm → `versions.rollback` mutation → new version v4 created with `parentVersionId = v3` and `sourceVersionId = v2`.
6. Redirected to v4 in the editor, which renders a provenance badge "rolled back from v2".

### 7.6 BYOK blocker flow

1. User tries to click **Run prompt** on a version with no OpenRouter key set for the org.
2. Run button is disabled with a tooltip: "No OpenRouter key set. Set one to run prompts."
3. Clicking the disabled button shows an inline callout below it: "**Set your OpenRouter key →** [link to /orgs/:orgSlug/settings/openrouter-key]".
4. User clicks through, sets the key, returns. (Browser back OR the "Return" CTA on the BYOK screen returns to the exact version editor URL.)
5. Run button is now enabled → user clicks Run.

---

## 8. Interaction patterns

High-leverage interactions that need specific definition.

### 8.1 Tiptap comment-on-selection

The core annotation interaction. Used in [[#4.18 Output viewer with Tiptap annotations]], [[#4.19 Prompt feedback view]], and [[#4.28 Blind evaluator view]].

1. User selects text via click-drag or shift+arrow.
2. A small floating comment button (`💬 + Comment`, or an icon-only button with `aria-label="Add comment"`) fades in at the trailing end of the selection, anchored to the viewport coordinates of the selection rect.
3. Clicking the button opens a popover anchored to the selection:
   - Textarea (autofocused).
   - Submit button (primary, disabled until non-empty).
   - Cancel button or Esc.
4. On Submit (`⌘Enter`), a new `outputFeedback` or `promptFeedback` row is inserted via a Convex mutation. The mutation writes the Tiptap `{from, to, highlightedText, comment}`.
5. The annotation persists as a colored highlight on the same range. The popover closes.
6. Hovering any highlight opens a tooltip-ish hover card with the comment text (and author name, except in evaluator view). Clicking opens a thread side panel with full edit/delete affordances if the current user is the author.

**Blind eval constraint.** In evaluator view, the hover card never shows the author's name. Only the comment text.

### 8.2 Prompt feedback annotations

Identical mechanics to output feedback but scoped to a version's `systemMessage` or `userMessageTemplate`. The only difference is the `targetField` discriminator on the stored annotation and the fact that these feedback items don't need blind labels — the commenter can always see the prompt they're annotating (only editors and owners leave prompt feedback).

### 8.3 Streaming output render

- Chunks arrive from `runs.appendOutputChunk` and are appended to `runOutputs.outputContent`.
- The Convex reactive subscription causes the `<StreamingOutputPanel>` to re-render.
- Text jumps in at natural chunk boundaries — **no** typewriter animation. Typewriter animations are slower than the actual data and imply a fake loading effect. We want "live".
- A `▋` cursor character is appended at the tail of the rendered text (via CSS `::after` on the last text node) until `runOutputs.status === 'completed' || 'failed'`.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` pauses the cursor blink.
- When the stream completes, the cursor disappears, the status pill flips to `completed`, and the token counts and latency fade in below the text (one-frame fade, not a bounce).

### 8.4 Diff view

- Default: side-by-side. Toggle to unified.
- Colors: blue for the "new" side, purple for the "old" side. **No red/green.** Color-blind safe and avoids implying "red = bad".
- Moves detected and highlighted in a third color (teal) with a "moved" icon rather than as paired delete+add.
- Gutter shows line numbers in the old version, line numbers in the new version, and a change marker (`+`, `-`, `~`).
- Clicking a change highlights the corresponding location in the `changesReasoning` panel (in the optimization review screen).

### 8.5 Drafts vs active vs archived

- **Draft**: editor has a dashed border. Header pill shows "DRAFT" in muted color. Run button enabled.
- **Active**: solid border. Header pill shows "ACTIVE v3" in an accent color. Run button enabled. Editing is blocked — edits require creating a new draft from this version.
- **Archived**: solid muted border. Header pill shows "ARCHIVED v2". Run button disabled. Editing blocked. Used for viewing historical versions.
- **Rolled back**: same border as Active + a small provenance badge "from v2" next to the version number.

### 8.6 Error surfacing

- **Validation errors** (bad template syntax, missing variable) → inline, near the field that caused the error. Never a toast.
- **Ephemeral errors** (save failed, retry worked) → toast in the lower-right. Auto-dismiss after 5s.
- **Auth / permission errors** → full-screen error view with a sensible CTA. Never inline.
- **Network errors** → inline banner at the top of the affected area with a retry.
- **Confirmation of destructive actions** → modal with explicit consequence language. Never a toast.

### 8.7 Concurrent run cap feedback

When the project is at the soft cap:
- The Run button shows a tooltip: "10 runs in flight. Wait for one to finish before starting another."
- `<ConcurrentRunGauge>` at the top of the editor's right pane shows "10 / 10" with a warning color.
- The mutation will also throw on the server side; the client catches this and re-surfaces the same message.

---

## 9. Empty / error / loading state catalog

Every zero-state has a specific, actionable copy. "No X found" is banned. Phrasing is "do this next", not "nothing is here".

### Empty states

| Screen | Copy | CTA |
|---|---|---|
| Org home | "No projects yet. Create your first project to start drafting prompts." | New project |
| Project home (new project) | "Draft your first prompt to get started." | Open editor |
| Version editor (no variables) | "Variables appear here. Add one and reference it with `{{name}}` in your template." | Add variable |
| Version editor (no test cases) | "Add a test case to run this prompt." | New test case |
| Version editor (no OpenRouter key) | "Set your OpenRouter key to run prompts." | Set key |
| Test case manager | "Test cases let you run the same prompt against multiple inputs. Create your first." | New test case |
| Variable manager | "Variables are project-scoped placeholders you can reference in any version. Create your first." | Add variable |
| Meta context | "Meta context feeds the optimizer. Add a question before your first optimization to ground the rewrite in your project's intent." | Add question |
| Run detail (no feedback) | "No feedback yet. Select text in any output to leave an annotation." | — |
| Feedback viewer (no feedback) | "No feedback for this version yet." | — |
| Version list (new project) | "v1 will appear here after you save your first draft." | — |
| Compare screen | "Pick a test case and at least two versions to compare." | — |
| Collaborators (just owner) | "You're the only collaborator. Invite someone to start leaving feedback." | Invite |
| Evaluator inbox | "You're all caught up. Waiting for new runs." | — |
| Optimizations list | "No optimization requests yet." | — |

### Error states

| Kind | Copy | CTA |
|---|---|---|
| Session expired | "Your session expired. Sign in to continue." | Sign in |
| Permission denied | "You don't have access to this." | Back |
| Not found (404) | "We couldn't find that page." | Home |
| Couldn't load | "Couldn't load {resource}." | Retry |
| OpenRouter down | "OpenRouter didn't respond. Try again, or check the OpenRouter status page." | Retry |
| Bad OpenRouter key | "OpenRouter rejected your API key. Check it in org settings." | Open key settings |
| Run failed | "Output {blindLabel} failed: {errorMessage}" | Retry output |
| Optimization failed | "The optimizer returned {reason}. Try again, or adjust the meta-prompt." | Try again |
| Concurrent run cap | "10 runs in flight. Wait for one to finish before starting another." | — |
| Template validation | "Unknown variable `{{x}}`. Add it to the project's variables or remove the reference." | — |
| Magic link expired | "This sign-in link expired. Get a new one." | Send another |

### Loading states

- **Org home**: skeleton rows (5) with project-name-length + status-pill-length + avatar-stack-length.
- **Project home**: skeleton of the 2/3 + 1/3 split, current version card + recent runs stubs.
- **Version editor**: skeleton of the three-column layout.
- **Run execution view**: three empty `<StreamingOutputPanel>`s in `pending` state — not a spinner — with "Waiting for OpenRouter..." hint at the center of each column.
- **Optimization waiting**: soft-pulsing card, not a spinner, with the live input preview underneath.

## 10. Blind eval security rules

The single most important section of this doc. Every rule is a test that can be run against the built UI to verify that version information does not leak to an evaluator via a browser surface. The backend enforces blind eval at the Convex function boundary (per [[Hot or Prompt - Architecture#Authorization Model]]); these rules close the browser-side gap.

Every rule has an acceptance test format you can run in devtools.

1. **The `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` route is the only route an evaluator can visit.** Any other route redirects to `/eval` with no flash of unrendered content. **Test**: sign in as evaluator, paste `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId` → should bounce to `/eval` instantly.
2. **The opaque token is server-generated, short-lived (1 hour), and does not contain `runId`, `versionId`, or `projectId` as substrings.** Generated server-side via `crypto.randomUUID()` or an HMAC. **Test**: decode the token → assert no ID substring matches.
3. **The page `<title>` on the evaluator view is exactly `"Evaluation — {project name}"`.** No version number, version name, or version ID. **Test**: `document.title` on `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` → regex match.
4. **Breadcrumbs on the evaluator view show only "Evaluation".** Not a project → version chain. **Test**: no breadcrumb component rendered at all in the evaluator shell.
5. **The tab favicon is the generic app icon.** Never a project-specific or version-specific icon. **Test**: `link[rel=icon]` href is the default.
6. **Tooltips on output panels show only the blind label.** No hover reveals model, temperature, latency, token count, timestamp, test case name, or trigger user. `<BlindLabelBadge>` has `aria-label="Output A"` and no other tooltip. **Test**: hover every interactive element in the evaluator view → no network request fetches anything beyond `{blindLabel, outputContent, annotations}`.
7. **A user who is both Editor and Evaluator on the same project is treated as Editor and the eval route blocks them.** The `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` route checks the user's role on the underlying project and, if they have any role above Evaluator, shows a full-screen notice: "You're an editor on this project. You cannot participate in blind evaluation here." You cannot be blinded to information you already have. **Test**: assign a user both roles, visit `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`, assert the notice renders.
8. **API responses to `runs.getOutputsForEvaluator` contain only `{ blindLabel, outputContent, annotations }[]`.** No additional fields. **Test**: open devtools network tab on `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`, inspect the response payload, assert no `runId`, `versionId`, `projectId`, `model`, `temperature`, `latencyMs`, `promptTokens`, `completionTokens`, `createdAt`, or any other metadata.
9. **Export / copy-to-clipboard on an output includes only the text content.** Never the source version. The "Copy" button produces plain text, never a rich payload with HTML data-attributes carrying metadata. **Test**: copy an output → paste into a text editor → assert the clipboard contains only the visible text.
10. **Image attachments in vision runs have EXIF metadata stripped before upload.** EXIF can contain camera model, GPS, timestamp — all potential leaks. The client strips EXIF on upload via `canvas`-based re-encoding; the server double-checks and rejects any image with EXIF present. **Test**: upload an image with GPS EXIF → download it back → assert no EXIF on the returned file.
11. **URL share / "copy link" from the evaluator view copies only the `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` URL.** No query params, no fragments, no referrer. **Test**: click the share icon → check clipboard contents.
12. **Manually entering any route under `/orgs/:orgSlug/...` as an evaluator redirects to `/eval`.** Redirect is server-side (Convex auth gate) AND client-side (React Router gate). **Test**: paste the URL, expect bounce.
13. **View-source and devtools do not reveal version metadata in hidden DOM nodes or data attributes.** No `data-version-id`, no `data-run-id`, no hidden `<script>` blob with the full run object. All metadata stays on the server. **Test**: open devtools elements tab, grep for `data-version`, `data-run`, `version-id`, `run-id` — zero matches.

**Design principle carried forward:** Blind eval is a security surface, not a UX convenience. When in doubt, strip metadata.

## 11. Accessibility

- **Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **Keyboard navigation**: every primary action (annotate, run, optimize, compare, accept, rollback, invite) has a keyboard path and a shortcut listed in [Section 13](#13-keyboard-shortcuts).
- **Focus ring**: visible on all interactive elements. Matches the brand accent color. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Screen reader labels**: every icon-only control (model picker, status pill, blind label badge, delete button, drag handle) has an `aria-label`.
- **Color contrast**: ≥ 4.5:1 on all text against its background. ≥ 3:1 on large text. No text on top of images without a scrim.
- **Diff view non-color cues**: every added/removed line has a leading icon (`+`, `-`, `~`) in addition to the color. Moves have a distinct icon. Screen readers announce "added", "removed", "moved".
- **Streaming cursor**: `▋` blink pauses when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.
- **Modals**: trap focus on open, restore focus on close, close with `Esc`, click-outside-to-close for non-destructive modals and click-outside-is-ignored for confirmation modals.
- **Tiptap annotation flow is keyboard-operable**: select text with `shift+arrow`, trigger the comment button with `C`, submit with `⌘Enter`, cancel with `Esc`. Every annotation is reachable by tab-navigating through the highlights.
- **Live regions for streaming**: `<StreamingOutputPanel>` is `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce new content without interrupting. The status pill updates use `aria-live="polite"` too.
- **Blind label badges** announce as "Output A" etc.
- **Forms** use `<label>` for every input. Error messages are associated via `aria-describedby`.

## 12. Microcopy guide

### Tone

- **Concise, technical, no hype.** "Run prompt" beats "✨ Generate magic ✨". "Request optimization" beats "Let AI improve your prompt!".
- **No apologies for normal behavior.** "Saving..." not "Please wait while we save your changes...".
- **Second-person voice where it's natural**, third-person where it's awkward. "Your API key is encrypted" not "The API key is encrypted". But: "Couldn't reach Convex" not "We couldn't reach Convex" (the former is shorter and implies the system).

### Error messages

- **Lead with what happened, not an apology.** "Couldn't reach OpenRouter." not "Oops! Something went wrong.".
- **Give the next action.** "Couldn't reach OpenRouter. Check your API key." not "Couldn't reach OpenRouter.".
- **Name the resource specifically.** "Couldn't load runs." not "Couldn't load data.".
- **Ban "Something went wrong" entirely.** Every error message must name the subsystem, the resource, or both.

### Button labels

- **Verb + noun, present tense, imperative.** "Run prompt", "Request optimization", "Accept changes", "Delete version", "Invite collaborator".
- **Destructive buttons are a distinct color (red)** with a verb that names the destruction explicitly: "Delete", "Remove", "Roll back", "Cancel run".
- **"Submit" is banned.** Prefer the specific verb: "Save", "Send", "Create", "Accept".

### Confirmation dialogs

- **State the irreversible action explicitly** in the body, not the title.
- "**Delete version 3?** Associated runs and feedback will also be deleted. This can't be undone."
- "**Remove Alice?** They'll lose access to this project immediately."
- "**Roll back to v2?** This creates a new version at the head of the timeline with the content of v2."

### Empty states

- **Describe the next action, not the current emptiness.** "Create your first test case to start running prompts." not "No test cases found.".
- **One sentence.** Anything longer hides the CTA.
- **The CTA verb matches the next action.** "New test case", not "Get started".

### Status text

- **Present tense for in-progress, past for completed.** "Running..." / "Completed 12s ago".
- **Relative time for recent, absolute for old.** "2m ago", "12h ago" for under 48h; "Apr 8" for older.
- **Token counts abbreviated**: "1.2k tokens" not "1,247 tokens" unless precision matters (billing / auditing).

### Onboarding callouts

- **Explain the next step, not the feature.** "Click Run to see your prompt execute" not "Hot or Prompt runs your prompt with streaming LLM output across multiple outputs simultaneously to enable comparison".
- **One callout at a time.** Never more than one visible.
- **Always dismissible.**

## 14. Responsive model

### Breakpoints

- **Desktop (≥1280px)**: full experience. Primary target.
- **Tablet (768–1279px)**: not a primary target; editor routes render but may be narrow. Compare screen collapses from a grid to a horizontal scroll. No special optimization — the goal is "works", not "great".
- **Mobile (<768px)**: only `/eval` and `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` and `/profile` are supported. Every other route shows a "desktop required" screen with a single sentence: "Hot or Prompt is a desktop tool. Open this on a computer."

### Why mobile eval is supported

Evaluators are often mobile-first users responding to review requests from email. The eval inbox needs to work on a phone. The editing experience doesn't — authoring prompts on a 375px screen would hurt more than it would help.

### Mobile evaluator view specifics

- Three output columns collapse to a single vertical stack. Scroll from output A → B → C.
- The comment popover becomes a full-screen sheet rather than an anchored popover (selection positioning on mobile is unreliable).
- `J/K` shortcuts become swipe-left / swipe-right on mobile.
- The "Submit feedback" button is a sticky bottom bar.

## 15. Onboarding

### Progressive disclosure

- **Advanced run settings** (seed, top-p, stop sequences) are hidden behind a "More" toggle on first run. Once expanded, they stay expanded for that user across sessions (preference stored in `users.preferences`).
- **Meta context** is not required, but the first optimization attempt on a project with no meta context shows an inline notice: "Optimize without meta context? Meta context helps ground the rewrite in your project's intent. Set it up first, or continue."
- **Temperature default is 0.7.** Users can always change it; we don't ask on first run.

### Sample project seed

On the org's first project creation modal, a checkbox: "Start with a sample project". If checked, the project is pre-populated with:
- A variable: `text`, description "The text to translate".
- A test case: "Casual paragraph" with a realistic English sample.
- v1 system message: "You are a translator. Render English text into natural, idiomatic French suitable for native speakers."
- v1 user template: "Translate: {{text}}"
- 3 meta context questions pre-answered ("What domain?" / "What tone?" / "Who's the end user?").

This gets the user to an interesting "Run prompt" click within 10 seconds of creating the project.

### Inline callouts (not a tour, not a modal)

Three one-time callouts shown in order, dismissible, never shown again per user:

1. **First version editor load**: callout pointing at the Run button. "Click Run to execute your prompt against the selected test case."
2. **First completed run**: callout pointing at the output text. "Select any text and press `C` to leave a comment."
3. **First annotation saved**: callout pointing at the Request Optimization button. "Optimize to turn your feedback into a new version."

No modal tour. No video. No welcome screen. Good empty states and three inline hints are enough.
