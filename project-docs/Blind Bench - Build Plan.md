# Blind Bench — Build Plan

> Part of [[MOC - Blind Bench]]

This doc expands the architecture doc's 10-bullet Next Steps into demoable milestones with explicit acceptance criteria. Every milestone is independently shippable to a preview URL and has a testable demo an AI agent or a human can self-verify.

The numbering starts at M0 to mirror "milestone zero = setup" conventions. Milestones are strictly sequential on the critical path except where the dependency graph below says otherwise.

See also:
- [[Blind Bench - Architecture#Next Steps]] — the short form of this doc
- [[Blind Bench - UX Spec]] — what each screen looks like (milestone deliverables reference screen IDs from this spec)
- [[Blind Bench - Optimizer Meta-Prompt]] — consumed by M5

---

## Context

The architecture doc's "Next Steps" section lists 10 bullets without acceptance criteria, without milestone boundaries, and without dependency notes. That's fine as a summary but not enough for an AI agent to work against: "build CRUD for projects" admits a thousand interpretations of "done". This doc grounds each milestone in:

1. **Concrete deliverables** — named schemas, functions, screens from the UX spec.
2. **Explicit acceptance criteria** — tests a human or agent can run to confirm the milestone is actually complete.
3. **A testable demo** — a short end-to-end story the user can walk through.
4. **Explicit out-of-scope** — what this milestone does NOT do, so the agent doesn't sneak forward into the next one.

If a milestone ships and the acceptance criteria pass, it is done. If acceptance criteria fail, it is not done regardless of how much code was written.

  M7 Landing page (parallel, separate deploy)
```

M0 → M6 is strictly sequential on the critical path. M7 (landing page on a separate Vercel project) can start any time after M0 and ship whenever; it has no dependencies on the app itself beyond a sign-in URL.

---

## M0 — Scaffold

**Goal**: a deployed Vercel URL that lets you sign in and see your email. Nothing else.

### Deliverables
- `npm create convex@latest` with the Vite React template.
- Convex project created and linked.
- Convex Auth configured with Google OAuth and magic link providers. Env vars set in Convex dashboard: `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_RESEND_KEY` (or equivalent magic link provider).
- Vite React app deployed to Vercel with `VITE_CONVEX_URL` pointing at the Convex deployment.
- A single protected route `/` that renders "Signed in as {email}" if authenticated and `/auth/sign-in` otherwise.
- A sign-in page at `/auth/sign-in` with the Google button + magic link form (see [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#4.2 Sign in]]).
- A magic link callback route.

### Acceptance criteria
1. Visiting the deployed Vercel URL while logged out redirects to `/auth/sign-in`.
2. Clicking Google sign-in completes the OAuth flow and lands back on `/` showing the user's email.
3. Requesting a magic link sends a real email; clicking the link signs the user in.
4. Directly calling a Convex query that does `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` returns `null` when unauthenticated and a valid identity when authenticated.
5. The preview URL is stable and accessible from outside Noah's machine.

### Testable demo
> Open the Vercel URL → click Google → complete OAuth → land on `/` → see "Signed in as noah@...". Sign out. Request a magic link → check email → click link → same landing.

### Out of scope
- Orgs, projects, anything beyond auth + an empty protected page.
- Styling beyond whatever Tailwind defaults look OK for a sign-in card.
- Role checks.

---

## M1 — Orgs, projects, collaborators

**Goal**: two users can each create an org, create a project, invite each other, and see the right things based on role.

### Deliverables

**Schema** (`convex/schema.ts`):
- `organizations` + `organizationMembers`
- `projects` + `projectCollaborators` with `role: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'evaluator'`
- (Defer `projectVariables`, `testCases`, `promptVersions`, `promptRuns`, etc. — those come in M2 and M3.)

**Helpers** (`convex/lib/auth.ts`):
- `requireAuth(ctx)` — returns `identity` or throws.
- `requireOrgRole(ctx, orgId, allowedRoles[])`.
- `requireProjectRole(ctx, projectId, allowedRoles[])`.

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/organizations.ts`: `createOrg`, `listMyOrgs`, `getOrg`, `updateOrg`, `inviteMember`, `updateMemberRole`, `removeMember`, `acceptInvitation`.
- `convex/projects.ts`: `create`, `list`, `get`, `update`, `delete`, `inviteCollaborator`, `updateCollaboratorRole`, `removeCollaborator`, `acceptInvitation`.

**Screens** (from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec]]):
- 4.4 First-run onboarding
- 4.5 Org home / project list
- 4.6 Org settings → general
- 4.7 Org settings → members
- 4.9 Project home (empty state only — no versions yet)
- 4.25 Project settings → general
- 4.26 Project settings → collaborators
- 4.30 Error screens (404, denied)

**Routing**:
- React Router with the routes from the UX spec's sitemap for everything under `/orgs/:orgSlug`.
- Role-aware shell from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#3 Role-aware shell]] — Owner/Editor shell for Owners and Editors, evaluator shell stubbed out (just the top bar; the inbox is empty in M1 since runs don't exist yet).

### Acceptance criteria
1. User A signs up → creates "Org A" → sees themselves as Owner in org settings.
2. User A creates Project P1 → is automatically the Owner.
3. User A invites User B as an Editor on P1. User B accepts the invite and sees P1 in their org list.
4. User A invites User C as an Evaluator on P1. User C accepts → lands on `/eval` (empty inbox).
5. User C manually navigates to `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/P1` → is redirected to `/eval` with no flash of project content.
6. User B cannot open org settings → redirected to a permission denied screen.
7. User A removes User B → User B no longer sees P1 in their project list.
8. All auth checks happen in Convex functions, not the UI. Disabling the UI redirect still fails the underlying query with "permission denied".

### Testable demo
> Two browser sessions. Session 1 creates an org, creates a project, invites session 2 as Editor and session 3 as Evaluator. Walk through each session's visible state. Confirm session 3 cannot access the project URL directly.

### Out of scope
- Variables, test cases, versions — none exist yet.
- Runs — impossible because versions don't exist.
- OpenRouter key UI — M3.
- Meta context editor — M2 or later.

---

## M2 — Variables, test cases, versions (no execution yet)

**Goal**: a user can define project variables, write a prompt version with `{{variable}}` placeholders, validate the template, manage test cases, and roll back.

### Deliverables

**Schema**:
- `projectVariables` (project-scoped)
- `testCases`
- `promptVersions` (with `parentVersionId`, `sourceVersionId`, `status`)
- `promptAttachments` (schema only; upload UI comes in M3 with run execution)

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/variables.ts`: `list`, `add`, `update`, `delete`, `reorder`.
- `convex/testCases.ts`: `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `reorder`.
- `convex/versions.ts`: `list`, `get`, `getCurrent`, `create`, `update` (draft only), `delete` (draft only), `rollback`, `promoteToActive`, `archive`.
- `convex/lib/templateValidation.ts`: `validateTemplate(template: string, variables: string[])` — throws on unknown variable references or unsupported Mustache syntax. Used in `versions.create`/`update`.

**Screens**:
- 4.10 Version list / history
- 4.11 Version editor (with validation, but the Run button is disabled with "not yet" tooltip — execution comes in M3)
- 4.12 Variable manager
- 4.13 Test case manager
- 4.14 Test case editor
- 4.15 Meta context Q&A editor
- 4.24 Version rollback confirmation modal

### Acceptance criteria
1. Create a variable `customer_name` → appears in the variable manager and as a chip in the version editor's variable list.
2. Write a v1 system message `You are a helpful assistant.` and user template `Hello {{customer_name}}` → save → v1 exists in the version list as a draft.
3. Try to save `{{unknown_variable}}` → template validation throws with "Unknown variable `{{unknown_variable}}`" on the specific field.
4. Try to save `{{#if something}}` → template validation throws with "Unsupported template syntax".
5. Promote v1 to active → v1 becomes read-only in the editor.
6. Create v2 as a draft branching from v1 → v2 has `parentVersionId = v1`.
7. Roll back to v1 → creates v3 with `parentVersionId = v2`, `sourceVersionId = v1`, and the content of v1.
8. Create a test case "Happy path" with `customer_name = "Noah"` and one attached image → reads back correctly.
9. Set 3 meta context questions → reads back correctly.
10. Deleting a variable referenced in any version is blocked with "This variable is used in version 2. Remove the reference first."

### Testable demo
> Create a project, add 2 variables, write v1 prompt, validate syntax, promote to active, branch v2, roll back to v1. Create 2 test cases. Set meta context.

### Out of scope
- Running the prompt (M3).
- Feedback / annotations (M4).
- Optimization (M5).
- Attachment upload and vision wiring (M3).

---

## M3 — BYOK + run execution (streaming)

**Goal**: a user can set their OpenRouter key, click Run, and see 3 outputs stream in live via Convex reactive subscriptions. Vision attachments work.

### Deliverables

**Schema**:
- `openRouterKeys` with encrypted key storage.
- `promptRuns` with `status` lifecycle (`pending` → `running` → `completed` | `failed`).
- `runOutputs` with `outputContent` accumulated via chunk-append, `blindLabel`, token counts, latency.

**Helpers**:
- `convex/lib/crypto.ts`: AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt with HKDF-derived key from `OPENROUTER_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` env var. Used by `setKey` and `getDecryptedKey`.
- `convex/lib/openrouter.ts`: OpenRouter HTTP client with streaming response parsing.

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/openRouterKeys.ts`: `setKey` (mutation, encrypts), `hasKey` (query, returns boolean only — never returns the key), `getDecryptedKey` (internal helper).
- `convex/runs.ts`: `execute` (mutation: creates `promptRuns` + N empty `runOutputs`, enforces concurrent-run cap, schedules the action), `list`, `get`, `appendOutputChunk` (internal mutation, called by the action on each streamed chunk).
- `convex/runsActions.ts`: `executeRunAction` (Node action: loads test case, substitutes variables, decrypts key, fires N parallel streaming OpenRouter calls, calls `appendOutputChunk` on each chunk, finalizes status + token counts on completion).
- `convex/attachments.ts`: `generateUploadUrl` (mutation), `registerUploaded`, `list`, `delete`, `reorder`. EXIF strip happens on upload (see [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#10 Blind eval security rules]] rule 10).

**Screens**:
- 4.8 Org settings → OpenRouter key
- 4.11 Version editor with the Run button now enabled
- 4.16 Run execution view (streaming)
- 4.17 Run detail (editor/owner)
- `<StreamingOutputPanel>` component
- `<ConcurrentRunGauge>` component
- `<RunStatusPill>` component
- `<ModelPicker>` component with vision filter

### Acceptance criteria
1. Owner can set an OpenRouter key → `openRouterKeys` row exists with an encrypted payload. The key is never visible in any query response, log, or client console.
2. After setting the key, the UI shows "Key set · last rotated {timestamp}". No way to reveal it.
3. With a key set, a test case selected, and a valid model chosen, clicking Run creates a `promptRuns` row and three `runOutputs` rows with empty content and blind labels A/B/C.
4. The client, subscribed to `runs.get(runId)`, sees the three outputs fill in live as chunks arrive. No polling.
5. On completion: `promptRuns.status` flips to `completed`, token counts and latency are written to each `runOutputs` row, and the UI renders them.
6. If OpenRouter returns a 401, the run fails cleanly with a user-facing error ("OpenRouter rejected your API key") and `promptRuns.status = 'failed'`.
7. Vision: a test case with an attached image runs successfully against a vision-capable model (e.g. Gemini 2.0 Flash). The image is passed as either base64 or a signed URL per the model's expected format.
8. EXIF: uploading an image with GPS coordinates → re-downloading the stored version has zero EXIF metadata.
9. Concurrent run cap: after 10 in-flight runs on a project, the 11th throws "10 runs in flight. Wait for one to finish before starting another." The cap is enforced in `runs.execute`, not just in the UI.
10. An Evaluator (from M1) still sees nothing — attempting to call `runs.get` as an Evaluator throws permission denied.

### Testable demo
> Set OpenRouter key → go to version editor → pick a test case → click Run → watch the three columns fill in live → click into the run detail and confirm token counts + latency.

### Out of scope
- Tiptap annotations (M4).
- Blind evaluator view (M4).
- Optimization (M5).
- Cross-version comparison (M6).
- Retry-failed-output (polish in M6).

## M4 — Tiptap annotations + blind eval (security boundary)

**Goal**: Owners and Editors can annotate outputs and prompts. Evaluators can annotate outputs in a blind view that rigorously prevents version leakage.

### Deliverables

**Schema**:
- `outputFeedback`
- `promptFeedback` (with `targetField: 'system_message' | 'user_message_template'`)

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/feedback.ts`: `addOutputFeedback`, `listOutputFeedback`, `updateOutputFeedback`, `deleteOutputFeedback`, `addPromptFeedback`, `listPromptFeedback`, `updatePromptFeedback`, `deletePromptFeedback`.
- `convex/runs.ts` additions: `getOutputsForEvaluator(runId)` — returns **only** `{ blindLabel, outputContent, annotations }[]` with no version, run, project, model, temperature, token count, or latency fields. Uses `requireProjectRole(ctx, projectId, ['evaluator'])`.
- `convex/lib/evalTokens.ts`: `mintEvalToken(runId, evaluatorUserId)` returns a 1-hour HMAC'd opaque token; `resolveEvalToken(token)` returns `{ runId, evaluatorUserId }` or throws on expiry/tamper. Tokens do NOT contain `runId`, `versionId`, or `projectId` as substrings.
- `convex/evaluatorInbox.ts`: `listMyInbox` (returns only `{ projectName, runSummary, invitedAt, status }`, one row per pending run for the current evaluator).

**Screens**:
- 4.18 Output viewer with Tiptap annotations
- 4.19 Prompt feedback view (in version editor, review mode)
- 4.20 Feedback viewer side-sheet
- 4.27 Blind evaluator inbox
- 4.28 Blind evaluator view
- `<AnnotatedEditor>` component (the main deliverable of this milestone)
- `<BlindLabelBadge>` component

**Route-level auth**:
- The evaluator shell from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#3 Role-aware shell]] is fully wired.
- `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` route exists, resolves the token server-side, and redirects to the inbox on failure.
- A user who is Editor or Owner on the underlying project is blocked at `/eval/:opaqueRunToken` per rule 7 in [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#10 Blind eval security rules]].

### Acceptance criteria

**Feedback mechanics (happy path)**:
1. Owner selects text in Output A → comment button appears → popover opens → types comment → submits → annotation persists as a highlight.
2. Owner can edit and delete their own annotation; cannot edit someone else's.
3. Prompt feedback on the system message and user template works the same way.
4. Feedback viewer side-sheet shows every annotation for a version grouped by target.

**Blind eval (security criteria — all must pass)**:
5. Evaluator in `/eval` sees only project name + run summary + timestamp. No version info, no model, no test case name.
6. Evaluator clicks a run → URL is `/eval/{opaqueToken}` with no IDs visible.
7. Page title on the evaluator view is exactly `Evaluation — {project name}`.
8. Devtools network tab: every response on the evaluator view is either a `listMyInbox` result or a `getOutputsForEvaluator` result. No field besides `blindLabel`, `outputContent`, `annotations` appears in any response. **Verified by inspecting the raw JSON payload.**
9. Evaluator manually calls `runs.get(runId)` via the Convex dashboard or devtools — throws permission denied.
10. Evaluator manually calls `versions.get(versionId)` — throws permission denied.
11. Evaluator manually tries to visit `/orgs/:orgSlug/projects/:projectId` — redirected to `/eval` with no flash of content.
12. A user assigned both Editor and Evaluator on the same project, visiting `/eval/:opaqueRunToken`, sees the block notice and cannot annotate in blind mode.
13. Uploading an image with GPS EXIF, then viewing it in the evaluator view → no EXIF in the served image.
14. `view-source` and devtools element inspector contain no `data-version-id`, `data-run-id`, `data-version`, `data-run` attributes anywhere in the DOM of the evaluator view.
15. Copy-to-clipboard from an output contains plain text only — no HTML `data-*` attributes carrying metadata.

**Each of the 13 rules in [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#10 Blind eval security rules]] is demonstrably enforced.**

### Testable demo

> **Part A (happy path)**: As Owner, run a prompt, annotate one output and one line of the prompt, see annotations in the feedback viewer.
>
> **Part B (adversarial security check)**: As Evaluator, sign in, confirm you can ONLY access `/eval` and `/eval/:token`. Open devtools on the evaluator view, check every Convex response, confirm no metadata fields present. Try to hit protected routes and functions directly. Confirm all blocked.

### Out of scope
- Optimization flow (M5).
- Cross-version comparison (M6).

---

## M5 — Optimization + human review

**Goal**: an Owner or Editor can request optimization, see the optimizer's proposed new prompt with reasoning, and accept / edit / reject it.

### Deliverables

**Schema**:
- `optimizationRequests` (with `status`, `generatedSystemMessage`, `generatedUserTemplate`, `changesSummary`, `changesReasoning`, `reviewStatus`, `resultingVersionId`, `optimizerPromptVersion`, `errorMessage`).

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/optimize.ts`: `requestOptimization` (mutation: creates row, schedules action), `getOptimization` (reactive), `cancelOptimization`, `acceptOptimization`, `rejectOptimization`, `editAndAcceptOptimization`, `listOptimizations`.
- `convex/optimizeActions.ts`: `runOptimizerAction` internal action that builds the `OptimizerInput` from [[Blind Bench - Optimizer Meta-Prompt#2 Input schema]], calls OpenRouter with the meta-prompt, validates the output per [[Blind Bench - Optimizer Meta-Prompt#5 Failure modes and action-level validation]], and writes the result.
- `convex/lib/optimizerPrompt.ts`: `OPTIMIZER_META_PROMPT_DEFAULT` constant (a clearly-marked placeholder TODO body for the owner to fill in), `OPTIMIZER_META_PROMPT_VERSION` constant (`v0.1-placeholder`). Env var `OPTIMIZER_META_PROMPT` overrides the constant when set.

**Screens**:
- 4.21 Optimization request (trigger + waiting)
- 4.22 Optimization review (diff + reasoning + accept/edit/reject)
- `<PromptDiff>` component
- `<ChangesPanel>` component

### Acceptance criteria
1. With an `OPENROUTER_KEY` set and feedback collected on v1, clicking "Request optimization" in the version editor creates an `optimizationRequests` row with `status: 'pending'` and schedules the action.
2. The optimization page (`/optimizations/:requestId`) shows the waiting screen with the input preview.
3. On completion, the review screen appears reactively — no refresh needed.
4. The `<PromptDiff>` renders the old vs new prompts side-by-side and toggles to unified.
5. `<ChangesPanel>` renders `changesSummary` (markdown bullets) and `changesReasoning` (prose).
6. Clicking **Accept** creates a new `promptVersions` row with `parentVersionId` = the source version, sets `optimizationRequests.reviewStatus = 'accepted'`, sets `optimizationRequests.resultingVersionId` to the new version, and redirects to the new version's editor.
7. Clicking **Reject** sets `reviewStatus = 'rejected'` and no new version is created.
8. Clicking **Edit and accept** opens an inline editor pre-populated with the proposed new prompt, lets the user tweak, then creates the new version with the edits + `reviewStatus = 'edited'`.
9. Validation failures from [[Blind Bench - Optimizer Meta-Prompt#5 Failure modes and action-level validation]] result in `status: 'failed'` with a user-facing error rendered on the review page (not a crash).
10. `optimizationRequests.optimizerPromptVersion` is set to the current `OPTIMIZER_META_PROMPT_VERSION` value.
11. With the placeholder meta-prompt, the action still completes successfully on a trivial input — the TODO body is just enough scaffolding to return valid JSON that passes validation. (The actual meta-prompt quality is the owner's iteration target post-M5.)
12. The concurrent-run cap does NOT apply to optimization actions — optimizations share a separate implicit cap (1 in-flight optimization per project) enforced by the optimize mutation.

### Testable demo
> Generate feedback on v1 → click Request optimization → watch the waiting screen → review screen appears → click Accept → new v2 exists with the proposed content and links back to the optimization request.

### Out of scope
- Cross-version comparison (M6).
- Meta-prompt iteration (owner's work, not part of the build).
- Showing optimization history on a version (polish in M6).

---

## M6 — Cross-version comparison + polish

**Goal**: the full feedback → optimize → compare → rollback loop works end-to-end on a sample project with good empty states, good error states, and the concurrent-run cap enforced.

### Deliverables

**Convex functions**:
- `convex/runs.ts` additions: `compareAcrossVersions({ testCaseId, versionIds })` — returns `{ versionId: Id<'promptVersions'>, run: promptRuns, outputs: runOutputs[] }[]`. Editor/Owner only.

**Screens**:
- 4.23 Cross-version comparison
- All empty states from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#9 Empty / error / loading state catalog]]
- All error states from the same section
- First-run onboarding callouts (3 total, from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#15 Onboarding]])
- Sample project seed checkbox in the "new project" modal
- `<ConcurrentRunGauge>` integrated into the version editor
- Keyboard shortcut cheat sheet modal (`?`)
- Command palette (`⌘K`) with project / version / test case / run fuzzy search

### Acceptance criteria
1. On the Compare screen, picking a test case and two or more versions runs any missing runs in parallel (reusing existing runs for matching test-case × version pairs) and renders a grid.
2. The concurrent-run cap throws on the 11th in-flight run and the client surfaces the message from the mutation.
3. Creating a new project with "Start with a sample project" checked pre-populates a variable, test case, v1, and meta context as described in [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#15 Onboarding]].
4. The three first-run callouts appear in order, dismissible, and never re-appear for the same user.
5. Every empty state and every error state from the UX spec is wired and matches the copy.
6. `⌘K` opens the command palette and can reach every screen.
7. `?` shows the shortcut cheat sheet with the shortcuts available on the current screen.
8. Rollback from v3 → v1 creates v4 with the content of v1 and provenance badge "rolled back from v1" visible in the version editor header.
9. End-to-end loop on a sample project: run v1 → annotate → optimize → accept → run v2 → annotate → compare v1/v2 on the same test case → roll back → run v3 — all without manual DB surgery or reading Convex logs to understand what happened.

### Testable demo
> Full end-to-end walkthrough on a freshly-seeded sample project, ending with a cross-version comparison and a rollback.

### Out of scope
- Landing page (M7).
- CLI / API access (explicitly deferred in [[Blind Bench - Architecture#v1 Scope & Deferred]]).
- Real-time collab / presence (deferred).

## M26 — Open Review (non-blind reviewer surface)

**Goal**: open the product to non-technical stakeholders (PM, legal, domain experts) by adding a second reviewer persona with full prompt context, gated by a per-invite `blindMode` flag. Today's blind reviewer (M4 / M10 path) is unchanged; M26 is the open-path counterpart.

> **Persona split.** M10 is the blind path — anonymous A/B/C ratings to keep feedback unbiased. M26 is the open path — informed feedback from someone who needs context. Same `evaluator` role literal in code; the `blindMode` flag selects the persona at invite time.

### Deliverables (issues #160 – #167, shipped as M26.1 – M26.7)

- **M26.1 — Schema substrate (#160).** Add `blindMode: v.optional(v.boolean())` to `projectCollaborators` and `invitations`. `invitations.create()` accepts the flag for `project_evaluator` / `cycle_reviewer` roles (defaults `true`); accept flow propagates to `projectCollaborators` for evaluator rows. Optional → no data wipe.
- **M26.2 — `isBlindReviewer` helper (#161).** New `convex/lib/auth.ts` helper returns `true` iff the principal is an evaluator collaborator with `blindMode ?? true`, or an unauthenticated guest. Rewires `runComments.listForRun` (peer-comment redaction + author-name blinding) and `reviewSessions.resolveScopeOrThrow` (session.role = "evaluator" vs "collaborator" decided by blindness, not role). Role-based mutation gates untouched.
- **M26.3 — Invite-time toggle (#162).** `InviteDialog` shows a "Blind review" checkbox (default ON) for reviewer roles; piped into `invitations.create`. `lookupByToken` returns `blindMode`; landing page header verb + callout vary by mode. Email subject/headline/body branch on `blindMode` for project-scoped reviewer invites.
- **M26.4 — Reviewer dashboard (#163).** New `convex/reviewerHome.getProjectReview` query + `/review/:projectId` route. Sections: project header, current-version preview (markdown), runs-waiting-for-feedback (reactive unread counts), drafts-waiting. `runs.get/list` and `versions.get/getCurrent` admit `evaluator + !blindMode`; blind evaluators stay denied. Invite-accept routes `blindMode === false` project invites here.
- **M26.5 — Read-only `VersionEditor` mode (#164).** `isNonBlindReviewer = role === "evaluator" && blindMode === false` drives a unified read-only path. Right pane hidden, Run/Save/Fork/Optimize buttons hidden, breadcrumb shows "{project} · Latest draft". `feedback.addPromptFeedback` / `listPromptFeedback` admit non-blind evaluators. `RoleBadge` gains a sky "reviewer" variant distinct from amber "evaluator" (blind).
- **M26.6 — Feedback acknowledgment + new-draft email (#165).** Toast confirmation after a non-blind reviewer submits a prompt annotation. New `reviewerNotifications` dedup ledger + `reviewerNotificationActions.sendNewDraftEmails` (Node + Resend) scheduled from `versions.update` after auto-promote to `current`. Rate-limited to one email per (reviewer, project) per 24h. Body includes optimizer's `changesSummary` if applicable.
- **M26.7 — Jargon sweep + Glossary (#166).** Reviewer surfaces relabel "Runs" → "Examples", "User/Assistant/System" → "Example question / Sample answer / Instructions", and the VersionEditor tab strip / editor onboarding callouts hide for non-blind reviewers. Glossary gains "Blind Mode" and "Reviewer" entries.
- **M26.8 — Doc updates (#167).** This entry, plus the Architecture authorization model + invite flow diagram + UX Spec Section 10 + Open Review subsection.

### Acceptance criteria

1. Inviting with `blindMode: false` produces a `projectCollaborators.blindMode === false` row on accept; that user lands on `/review/:projectId` after accepting.
2. The 13 blind-eval rules in UX Spec Section 10 still pass for `blindMode === true` reviewers (criterion #2 of #161).
3. A `blindMode === false` reviewer can read prompts, runs, and versions; cannot mutate any of them (verified by direct Convex calls in `evalSecurity.test.ts`).
4. Editor publishes a new version → each non-blind reviewer receives at most one email per 24h with subject `New draft of {projectName} ready for your review` and CTA to `/review/:projectId`.
5. Reviewer-facing surfaces render none of `v1/v2/vN`, `DRAFT`, `ACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`, temperature values, or model names.
6. Glossary has a "Blind Mode" entry; UX Spec has the Open Review section; Architecture documents the role + blindMode split.

### Testable demo

> 1. As an owner, invite two collaborators to the same project: one with "Blind review" ON, one with it OFF. 2. Accept both invites in separate browsers. 3. The blind one lands on `/eval`; the open one lands on `/review/:projectId`. 4. The open reviewer leaves a prompt annotation → sees the ack toast. 5. The owner edits and saves the version → both reviewers see the resulting state correctly (open reviewer gets the email; blind reviewer's session reflects the new outputs without leaking version metadata).

### Out of scope

- Renaming the `evaluator` literal in code → `reviewer`. Deferred to a later rename milestone.
- In-app notification bell expansion for reviewers (already exists; reused as-is).
- SMS / Slack delivery of new-draft notifications.
- Project-wide Glossary rename of "Evaluator" → "Reviewer" (bundled with the code rename).

## M21 — Multimodal (Image Variables)

**Goal**: support image inputs as a typed [[Blind Bench - Glossary#Project variable]]. Test cases supply per-variable image uploads that splice into user messages as `image_url` content blocks at dispatch. Mirrors OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible multimodal format (mime allowlist: jpeg/png/webp/gif; base64 data URLs; vision-capable models gated via `architecture.input_modalities`). LLM output remains text — images are input-only context.

> **Reactivation note.** M21 was originally scoped to in-prompt image paste/upload (extending `promptAttachments`). Reactivated 2026-04-29 with a redefined scope around image-as-variable, which is the surface users actually need. The original scope (issues #127, #128, #129) is closed as superseded; legacy `promptAttachments` behavior is unchanged and out of scope here.

### Deliverables (issues #177 – #187, shipped as M21.0 – M21.10)

- **M21.0 — Docs (#177).** This entry, plus Architecture (Data Model, Template Syntax §Image variables, File Storage, Function Index for `imageVariableAttachments.ts`), UX Spec (§4.12 Variable manager, §4.13 Test case manager, §4.14 Test case editor, §10 M21 surface addition), and Glossary (Image variable, updated Attachment / Project variable / Test case entries).
- **M21.1 — Schema (#178).** Add `type: "text" | "image"` to `projectVariables` (default text). Add `variableAttachments: record<string, _storage id>` to `testCases`. Reject `defaultValue` on image-typed variables. Lock type at creation (update mutations cannot change it).
- **M21.2 — Storage module (#179).** New `convex/imageVariableAttachments.ts` (mirrors `attachments.ts`): `generateUploadUrl`, `getUrl`, `delete`. Mime allowlist (jpeg/png/webp/gif), 5MB cap, zero-byte rejection. Owner/editor only on write paths.
- **M21.3 — Template validation (#180).** Extend `convex/lib/templateValidation.ts`: `{{varName}}` tokens for image-typed variables may only appear in messages with role `user`. Reject in system / developer / assistant with named error. Wired into `versions.create` and `versions.update`.
- **M21.4 — Variable definition UI (#181).** Type radio in `AddVariableDialog` (Text / Image, default Text). Hide `Default value` when Image is selected. Variables table column shows type with icon. Type radio disabled in edit mode (cannot change after creation).
- **M21.5 — Test case editor upload widget (#182).** Branch `TestCaseEditor` rendering on variable type. Image vars get a dropzone with empty / uploading / uploaded states, replace + remove buttons. Replace deletes the prior storage blob atomically; remove deletes the blob and clears the entry; cancelled uploads are cleaned up on cancel/unmount. Required-image-no-value blocks save.
- **M21.6 — Dispatch (#183).** Rewrite `buildDispatchMessages` to walk user messages for `{{imageVar}}` tokens and emit `[text, image_url, text]` content arrays. Image blocks are base64 data URLs (`data:<mime>;base64,...`) fetched fresh per run from Convex storage. Messages with no image tokens still emit `content: string`. `promptAttachments` (in-prompt images) continue to append to the last user message.
- **M21.7 — Vision capability gate (#184).** Extend `convex/modelCatalog.ts` to capture `architecture.input_modalities` from OpenRouter `/api/v1/models`. Pre-dispatch check in `runs.execute`: if test case has any non-empty `variableAttachments`, model must include `"image"` in `input_modalities`; otherwise fail run early with `"Model {modelId} doesn't support image inputs."`.
- **M21.8 — Optimizer guardrails (#185).** Update `OPTIMIZER_META_PROMPT` to declare image variable tokens as immutable scaffolding. Pass image variable names into the meta-prompt rendering. Post-process optimizer output: reject any rewrite that drops, renames, or relocates an image variable token out of a user message; retry once.
- **M21.9 — Blind eval visibility (#186).** Render image variable values as thumbnails in the test case context panel for all reviewer roles, including blind. Click → lightbox at full resolution. Audit against Section 10 — image is test input (allowed), not prompt content (forbidden). No `data-version-id` / `data-run-id` attributes on image elements; storage URLs stay opaque.
- **M21.10 — Cascade-delete (#187).** On test case delete, image-typed variable delete, or project delete: delete the referenced storage blobs (`ctx.storage.delete`). Idempotent. No orphans.

### Acceptance criteria

1. A project owner can create an image-typed variable (e.g., `image_attachment`) — `Default value` field is hidden in the dialog, type is locked after creation.
2. A test case for that project shows an upload widget for the image variable; uploading a JPG/PNG/WebP/GIF ≤ 5MB succeeds; uploading a TIFF, an SVG, or a 6MB file is rejected with a clear error.
3. Saving a version with `{{image_attachment}}` in the user template succeeds; saving with the same token in the system message is rejected with `"Image variable image_attachment cannot appear in system messages — image variables are user-message-only"`.
4. Running that version + test case against a vision-capable model (e.g., a GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet route) succeeds; the LLM's text response demonstrably uses information from the image. Running against a non-vision model fails before dispatch with `"Model {id} doesn't support image inputs."`.
5. Replacing the image on a test case deletes the prior storage blob (verified via `ctx.storage.list`); deleting a test case, an image variable, or a project deletes all referenced blobs.
6. The optimizer asked to rewrite a prompt containing `{{image_attachment}}` returns a rewrite that still contains exactly the same image variable token in a user message; an attempted rewrite that drops it triggers a single retry then surfaces an error to the requester.
7. A blind reviewer's session for a run on an image-bearing test case shows the image as a thumbnail in the test case context panel; the network response and rendered DOM contain no `versionId`, `runId`, `projectId`, model name, file size, or filename for the image (Rule 6, 8, 13 from [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#10 Blind eval security rules]]).
8. Glossary contains an `Image variable` entry; Architecture documents the schema, template syntax restriction, dispatch shape, and capability gate; UX Spec §4.12 / §4.13 / §4.14 reflect the type selector + upload widget; this Build Plan entry is present.

### Testable demo

> 1. Owner creates a project with one image variable (`image_attachment`, required) and one text variable (`task`). 2. Owner creates two test cases — each with a different uploaded image (PNG and JPEG) and a distinct `task` value. 3. Owner writes a version: system message `"You are a helpful assistant."`; user template contains both `{{task}}` and `{{image_attachment}}`. 4. Owner runs the version against test case A on a vision-capable Anthropic Claude model and a non-vision text model. 5. Vision run succeeds with three streaming outputs that reference image content; non-vision run fails before dispatch with the named error. 6. Owner replaces test case A's image, re-runs — old blob is gone from storage, new image is reflected in the dispatched payload. 7. Owner invites a blind reviewer; reviewer sees the image as a thumbnail in the test case context panel of `/eval/:token` with no leaked metadata. 8. Owner triggers optimization on the version — proposed rewrite preserves `{{image_attachment}}` in a user message verbatim.

### Out of scope

- **In-prompt image attachments on prompt versions** — existing `promptAttachments` behavior is unchanged. If the in-prompt-paste use case becomes a priority, file a follow-up milestone.
- **Audio / video / file inputs** — multimodal scope is images only in v1.
- **Image generation outputs** — LLM still returns text only; this milestone is input-side only.
- **Lists of images per variable** — exactly one image per variable per test case in v1.
- **Project-level default images** — image variables have no `defaultValue`. Each test case supplies its own.
- **Run history snapshotting** — runs reference live test cases; if an image is replaced after a run, looking back at the run shows the current image (same drift as text variables today). Filed as a separate forward-looking issue (#188).

## M29 — Onboarding redesign

**Goal**: replace the silent auto-seed-and-redirect flow with an opinionated entrypoint that lands first-run users in a real, mutable project from minute zero. Cuts the "this is a sample / create your own" dead-end the M28 read-only sample created.

### Deliverables (issues #199 – #204, shipped as M29.3 – M29.8)

- **M29.3 — Mutable starter (#199).** Stop writing `isSample: true` on seeded `projects` / `promptVersions` / `testCases` / `promptRuns` / `runOutputs` / `outputFeedback` / `optimizationRequests`. `assertProjectMutable` becomes a no-op (still imported at call sites; M29.8 deletes it). RootRedirect falls back to org home if the seeded version's deep-link target hasn't materialized yet.
- **M29.4 — Welcome screen (#200).** New `/welcome` route (`src/routes/welcome/WelcomeFirstRun.tsx`). Two paths: `projects.createFromPaste(content, role)` (paste a prompt; auto-detect `{{variables}}`; create v1 draft) and `projects.cloneStarter()` (materialize the starter fixtures). Both call `ensurePersonalOrgFor` to lazily create the workspace. RootRedirect routes zero-project users here instead of auto-seeding.
- **M29.5 — Inline BYOK at the run button (#201).** New `<InlineBYOKModal>` intercepts the Run click when the org has no key, saves it, and immediately re-fires the run with the same args via the new `executeAllRuns` callback. The persistent missing-key callout is dropped for owners; non-owners keep an ask-your-admin variant.
- **M29.6 — Post-first-run collab nudge (#202).** New `runs.firstSuccessfulRun(projectId)` query, `invitations.mintShareableProjectInvite(projectId)` mutation (with reuse to keep clicks idempotent), and `onboarding.collabNudge(orgId)` gate. Co-pilot panel raises a high-priority "Get feedback — copy invite link" card; one click mints a shareable `project_evaluator` invite and writes the URL to the clipboard. Hides on dismiss or when any other reviewer joins.
- **M29.7 — Co-pilot ambient steps retune (#203).** New STEPS sequence: write_prompt → run_eval → compare_model → promote_test_case. Replaces the M28 setup-checklist (add_key, write_prompt, run_eval, leave_feedback, accept_optimizer). `onboarding.copilotProgress` reads each step off real project state on the user's first owned project; the M29.6 collab card sits above the list as a higher-priority surface.
- **M29.8 — Cleanup (#204).** Drop `isSample` from all six tables (`projects`, `promptVersions`, `promptRuns`, `runOutputs`, `outputFeedback`, `optimizationRequests`), drop `assertProjectMutable` and the dead `isSampleFlow` wiring in optimizer activation telemetry. Delete `<SampleProjectBanner>`, `<ByokGateModal>`, `useOnboardingProgress`. Remove `OnboardingTour` from the Architecture component table. Drop dead NextActionRing call sites for the deprecated targets (add_key, leave_feedback, accept_optimizer).

### Acceptance criteria

1. A first-run user clicking the Run button in the starter project sees the run execute (assuming BYOK is set or saved via the inline modal). No "this is a sample" error fires anywhere.
2. Zero-project users land on `/welcome` post-auth; both paths create a fully-mutable project the user owns.
3. After a fresh user's first successful run on their first owned project, the co-pilot raises the "Get feedback" card. One click copies a working `/invite/:token` URL to the clipboard. The card hides after dismiss or after any reviewer accepts.
4. `grep isSample` and `grep assertProjectMutable` return no matches outside historical docstrings. The `isSample` field is gone from the schema; existing data was wiped pre-launch per M25 policy.
5. No "This is a sample…" or "Create your own project…" copy remains in any UI surface.

### Testable demo

> 1. Sign in as a brand-new user. 2. See the welcome screen with two paths. 3. Pick "Show me an example" → land in the starter editor. 4. Click Run → InlineBYOKModal opens; paste a key → the run fires immediately. 5. Wait for the run to complete; the co-pilot panel surfaces "Get feedback". 6. Click → URL copied to clipboard. 7. Open it in a fresh browser → InviteLanding routes the recipient through the cycle review surface.

### Out of scope

- A separate "demo mode" use case for the dropped `assertProjectMutable` chokepoint. Filed for a future milestone if marketing needs a read-only public surface.
- Backfill of pre-existing `isSample` data; per project memory, pre-launch we wipe Convex data instead of migrating.

## M7 — Landing page (separate Vercel deployment)

**Goal**: a public marketing URL that funnels to the app's sign-in.

### Deliverables
- A second Vercel project, separate codebase or subfolder, deploying from a `landing/` directory or a separate repo.
- A single static page with tagline, short explainer, and a "Sign in" button pointing at the app's `/auth/sign-in` URL.

### Acceptance criteria
1. The landing URL resolves publicly.
2. The "Sign in" button links to the app, preserving a redirect-back target if meaningful.
3. The landing is independently deployable without affecting the app.

### Testable demo
> Visit the landing URL anonymously, click Sign in, complete the flow, land on the app.

### Out of scope
- Marketing content beyond a tagline and a paragraph.
- SEO work.
- Analytics beyond the Vercel default.

## Out of scope for v1 (restated)

These carry forward from [[Blind Bench - Architecture#v1 Scope & Deferred]] so this doc is self-contained:

- **Real-time collaborative editing**. Single-editor-at-a-time with last-write-wins in v1.
- **Langfuse / LiteLLM observability**. The action-layer seam exists; wiring is a future PR.
- **Multi-org admin flows**. Basic create/invite works; audit logs, SSO, SCIM wait.
- **Billing / pricing / dollar budgets**. BYOK sidesteps this.
- **Per-user rate limits**. Only the concurrent-run cap.
- **CLI / CI-CD integrations**. Possible later because everything is a Convex function.
- **Branching versions**. Linear only in v1; schema leaves room.
- **External HTTP API**. Deferred — would be a thin `convex/http.ts` layer with `httpAction` wrappers.

---

## Testing strategy per milestone

**Manual smoke per milestone**: walk the testable demo end-to-end on the deployed Vercel URL. This is the primary verification mechanism.

**Convex function-level assertion tests**:
- M1: `requireProjectRole` behavior under each role.
- M3: `runs.execute` concurrent cap, encryption round-trip on `openRouterKeys`.
- **M4 (non-negotiable)**: every authorization check on the runs/versions/feedback functions must have a test proving an Evaluator is rejected and an Editor/Owner is allowed. Plus a test that `getOutputsForEvaluator` returns only the expected fields.
- M5: optimizer output validation — every failure mode from [[Blind Bench - Optimizer Meta-Prompt#5 Failure modes and action-level validation]] has a test that feeds in a crafted bad output and asserts the request fails with the right error message.

**No E2E framework in v1.** Playwright and similar are deferred.

**Adversarial check at M4**: sit down with devtools open and try to break blind eval. Check every rule in [[Blind Bench - UX Spec#10 Blind eval security rules]] manually. If you find a leak, the milestone is not done.

---

## Definition of done (per milestone)

A milestone is done when ALL of:

1. **Every acceptance criterion passes** on the deployed Vercel URL.
2. **The testable demo runs end-to-end** without manual intervention beyond the steps described.
3. **Architecture doc and UX spec are still accurate**. If the milestone required changes, update the docs in the same commit.
4. **A short demo clip or walkthrough is captured** (video or structured screenshots) so the user can verify without running it themselves.

A milestone is not done if:
- Acceptance criteria are "mostly passing".
- Tests exist but fail.
- The testable demo requires manual DB edits or console hacks to work.
- The agent claims success without walking the demo.
